This website is meant to provide a list of cat breeds for you to select from. Once you click on a cat breed from the drop down selector, you will see some cool details related to that cat breed along with a random photo of that particular breed.

I used [The CAT API](thecatapi.com) to fetch this data. Particulary to filter by breed and receive details about that specific breed and photos.
